        <img src='rss_logo.gif' alt='RSS logo' border=0  valign=bottom height = 25 width = 27> or XML
        <img src='xml.gif' alt='RSS logo' border=0  valign=bottom height = 25 width = 27>
        can be used to represent sites that offer feeds. Often, if a user clicks one of these links, he/she will most
        likely get a page full of codes or unorganised content in browser. To properly read the feed, users need an RSS reader.
